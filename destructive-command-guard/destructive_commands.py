"""Deny a small set of catastrophic Bash commands before your agent executes them.

This file is the surface adapter: it reads whatever payload shape the calling
agent sends, asks guard_core for a verdict, and writes that verdict back in the
shape that agent understands. The matching logic lives in guard_core.py and is
identical on every surface.

Supported envelopes are detected automatically from the payload:

  claude       Claude Code and Codex   tool_input.command            exit 0
  antigravity  Antigravity             toolCall.args.CommandLine     exit 0

Only surfaces confirmed working in a live session are listed. Others have been
implemented and removed again pending confirmation; see the git history.

Set DESTRUCTIVE_GUARD_ENVELOPE to one of those names to skip detection.

Adding a surface means adding one entry to ENVELOPES below. Nothing in
guard_core.py should need to change.
